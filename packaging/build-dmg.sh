# having it copied in afterwards. Drawn by Dikte itself, offscreen, which is

# without this the disk image would be an application that cannot record until

# Contents/MacOS is for the executable the bundle names, and integrate.py puts

# 4. Signing ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Ad-hoc, because there is no Developer ID to sign with. It is not decoration:
# macOS files a microphone or Accessibility permission against a code
# signature, and an arm64 binary carrying none is refused by the kernel outright
# rather than merely warned about. What it does not buy is Gatekeeper, which is
# why the README tells people how to get past the first-launch refusal.
#
# --deep is the wrong tool for a real signature and the right one here: every
# dylib PyInstaller collected plus the ffmpeg added above all need one, and
# adding ffmpeg invalidated the signature PyInstaller left.

# 5. The disk image --------------------------------------------------------

# that opens has the arrow to drag it onto. UDZO is the compressed read-only
# format every Mac has understood for twenty years.
