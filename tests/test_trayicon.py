"""The drawn icons, checked against the thing that made them necessary.

A tray never says what colour it is painting over, so the only question worth
asking of these pixmaps is whether they can be seen at all: a glyph drawn in
black on i3's black bar is an empty slot, which is what issue #27 was. So the
test blends each icon onto a bar of its own and asks whether anything of it
survives, once over black and once over white.
