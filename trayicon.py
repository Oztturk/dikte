"""The four tray icons, drawn here for systems that have no icon theme.

A desktop hands out `audio-input-microphone`, `media-record`, `view-refresh`
and `media-playback-pause` from whatever icon theme is installed, and Qt finds
them through QIcon.fromTheme. Two systems have nothing to hand out. macOS keeps
no such registry at all. And a Linux session that names no desktop, which is
what i3 and a bare X11 login are, leaves Qt with `hicolor` as its only theme,
where none of those four names exist. On both, fromTheme returns a null icon,
and a null icon in a tray is an item you cannot see, which is the whole of
Dikte's interface gone. So the same four shapes are drawn here, and used
whenever the theme has nothing to offer.

On macOS they are template images: one colour, transparent everywhere else,
with isMask set. That is what lets macOS invert them for a dark menu bar and
grey them while the menu is open, and it is why the shapes are outlines rather
than the coloured glyphs a Linux theme would give.

X11 has no such contract. A tray there is given a picture, paints it over
whatever colour the bar happens to be, and never says what that colour is, so
black ink on i3's black bar is an empty slot rather than an icon. The same
shapes are drawn there in white over a dark copy of themselves spread a pixel
outwards, which stands out on a dark bar and stays readable on a light one.
